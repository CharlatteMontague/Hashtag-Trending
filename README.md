Program that reads in hashtags from 2 files into two vectors and sorts them based on the number of times they appear in each file using operator overloading. The program will then output the hashtag with the highest rank, the hashtag that increased the most between files, the hashtag that decreased the most between files, and the 10 highest ranking hashtags only found in the new file.
